Ireland. It can be found at the front of the mound and is one of the most eye-catching monuments due to the many different engravings that the neolithic builders engraved beautifully.<\/span><\/font><br><\/p><p style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-size: 36px;\">For example, there are large triple spirals that are engraved into the kerbstone with double loops that fill nearly the entire left side of the stone. These spirals rotate clockwise on the way to the centre of the stone and anticlockwise on the opposite righthand side.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-size: 36px;\">We don\u2019t and probably will never know what these decorations mean or meant to the people who made them. However, that does not stop people from this age from trying to figure it out. One of the more common explanations or theories is that the large triple spirals represent the three hinge cairns.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium;\"><span style=\"font-size: 36px;\">The spiral on the right represents some of the smaller mounds and the wavy lines on the bottom represent the river Boyne. The other shapes in this case the rectangles, triangles and lozenges are said to be the fields of the first farmers.<\/span><\/p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; user-select: text; -webkit-user-drag: none; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; overflow: visible; cursor: text; clear: both; position: relative; direction: ltr; font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web&quot;, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\"><\/p><ul><\/ul><p><\/p><p style=\"margin: 0px 0px 0px 25px; padding: 0px; user-select: text; -webkit-user-drag: none; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: transparent; overflow: visible; cursor: text; clear: both; position: relative; direction: ltr; font-family: &quot;Segoe UI&quot;, &quot;Segoe UI Web&quot;, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\"><\/p><ul><\/ul><p><\/p>","height":null,"icon_custom":null,"password":null,"width":46},{"_id":"62843e27430c0120a23c9c62","title":"Roofbox Closeup","type":"image","position":{"x":-2.597519479184996,"y":-8.755626886485187},"scene_id":"6271aea935004b2c905892f3","project_id":"620421630aa3f50d33207d52","updated_at":"2022-05-18 07:38:59","created_at":"2022-05-18 07:30:31","caption":null,"distorted":null,"height":null,"icon_custom":null,"password":null,"src":"\/uploads\/vr\/620421630aa3f50d33207d52\/asset\/1652834149-0.JPG","theme_type":"fancybox","url":null,"width":45},{"_id":"62844037917b923eb0205002","title":"Roofbox Information(Text)","type":"article","position":{"x":-6.101742357564831,"y":-6.457970554414559},"scene_id":"6271aea935004b2c905892f3","project_id":"620421630aa3f50d33207d52","updated_at":"2022-05-24 03:26:48","created_at":"2022-05-18 07:39:19","content":"<p><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: 36px;\">On top of the entrance to the monument is the famous roof box.
